        <h3>Hello!</h3><br>
        <p>I'm Xander Holden. I grew up in Alaska, Coloroado, and Utah. I am married with 2 kids. 
        I am going into Computer Science as a major and hope that this course will help me improove
        in my understanding all aspects of programming.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the church for all of my life. I love how perfectly everything meshes 
        together in the church. God is a God of orden and his church would have to be orderly. 
        It is hard to disprove due to all the scriptural evidences.</p>
        <p>I currently work for the church and I am persueing my Major in Computer Science. I in turn 
        will be able to get a better paying job and provide for my family in this crazy economy.</p>
        <p>I love everything there is to know about mechanics and cars. I love singing and playing the guitar. 
        I am excited to be apart of this class and hope I can learn something from everyone.</p>
