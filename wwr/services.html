                                Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the
                                mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this
                                run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts
